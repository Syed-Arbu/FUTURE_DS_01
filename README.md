ðŸ“Š Sales Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI

About the Project:

This project is focused on interactive sales reporting and visualization using Power BI. The dataset (Superstore Sales) was analyzed to uncover insights about sales, profit, customer segments, categories, and regional performance.

I built a Power BI dashboard that allows stakeholders to:

Track total sales, profit, and quantity through KPIs.

Analyze sales performance by region, category, and sub-category.

Identify high-performing vs. low-performing product segments.

Use filters and slicers for dynamic analysis (Year, Category, Region).
